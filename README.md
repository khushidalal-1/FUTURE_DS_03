# 🚧 FUTURE_DS_03 – Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project was created as part of Task 3 during my internship at **Future Interns**. It focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover spatial and temporal trends using Excel and Power BI. The final dashboard brings data-driven insights into accident severity, vehicle involvement, and road hazards.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Map **high-risk accident locations** using geospatial filters
- Analyze **accident severity trends** across weekdays and time slots
- Understand the impact of **road types and carriageway hazards**
- Explore the distribution of **vehicle types** involved in incidents
- Create an **interactive, visually engaging dashboard** for stakeholder clarity

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
| Tool     | Purpose                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Power BI | Dashboard design, visuals, DAX      |
| Excel    | Data cleaning & preprocessing       |
| ArcGIS   | Exploratory mapping integration     |

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🚗 **Cars** are involved in nearly **76%** of all recorded incidents
- 📅 **Fridays and Mondays** are peak days for severe accidents
- 🛣️ Most accidents occur under **normal carriageway conditions**
- ❗ “**Other object on road**” was a significant hazard in many cases

## 🗺️ Dashboard Features
- **Interactive filters** by time, vehicle type, and severity
- **Map visualization** for pinpointing danger zones
- **Multi-format charts** to summarize trends intuitively
